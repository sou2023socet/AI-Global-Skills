# Skill - 058 - Navigation Routing And Url Design

## Purpose
Apply the reusable Navigation Routing And Url Design capability to the named project task without
silently expanding scope or permissions.

## Activation
- Activate when the task explicitly requires Navigation Routing And Url Design.
- Confirm project identity, scope, required evidence, and permission boundaries first.
- Do not activate for unrelated work or when a more specific canonical skill owns the task.

## Required procedure
1. Inspect the project context, applicable contracts, and existing implementation before acting.
2. Follow the source capability contract below, adapting examples to the actual project.
3. Record inputs, decisions, outputs, evidence, failures, and unresolved limitations.
4. Validate the acceptance criteria with the smallest approved check; never claim an unrun check.

## Failure handling
Stop on missing prerequisites, unknown project identity, unsafe permissions, or contradictory
evidence. Preserve partial work, report the exact blocker, and return control to the
orchestrator rather than inventing a successful result.

## Permissions
Read-only inspection is the default. File changes require task scope; execution, external
access, persistent writes, production impact, and generated artifacts require explicit
command-scoped approval.

## Acceptance criteria
- The requested capability is applied to the identified project and scope.
- Outputs are actionable, traceable to evidence, and free of secrets.
- Failures and unverified steps are explicit.

## Source capability contract

The following source-preserving contract is the basis for this canonical package:

# Navigation Routing and URL Design

## Metadata
- Skill name and stable identifier: Navigation Routing and URL Design (`navigation-routing-and-url-design`)
- Version: 1.0.0
- Status: active
- Domain: UI Kit and Component System
- Purpose and expected outcomes: Routes, navigation, deep links, breadcrumbs, query parameters, route guards, redirects, and URL safety.
- Relevant project types and technology categories: Web, mobile, desktop, APIs, and full-stack projects; Use the actual frontend framework and approved design system; do not impose a framework or component library.
- Trigger conditions: Route structure, navigation, deep links, redirects, URL parameters, or access guards are introduced or changed.
- Explicit non-trigger conditions: Do not invoke for unrelated work, routine changes fully owned by a narrower skill, or tasks whose required user approval is pending.
- Prerequisite skills: `ui-ux-research-and-information-architecture`, `application-shell-and-layout-system`, `role-based-access-and-api-security`
- Related skills: `ui-ux-research-and-information-architecture`, `application-shell-and-layout-system`, `role-based-access-and-api-security`
- Required tools: Read-only repository inspection and documentation tools; project-native tools only when necessary and approved.
- Optional tools: Static analysis, design tooling, accessibility checks, CI, or platform integrations when present and authorized.
- Risk classification: moderate
- Required permissions and approval conditions: Obtain explicit approval before production changes, destructive data operations, external cost, or tool-mediated design publication. Honor project-specific build/test/package gates; approval is scoped to named actions.

## Purpose and scope
This skill owns the task-specific workflow for routes, navigation, deep links, breadcrumbs, query parameters, route guards, redirects, and url safety. It produces verifiable, project-compatible artifacts without expanding into unrelated implementation. Use the actual frontend framework and approved design system; do not impose a framework or component library.

## Trigger conditions
Activate when the task matches the trigger in Metadata or when a prerequisite skill routes a directly dependent subtask here.

## Non-trigger conditions
Do not activate solely because a repository contains related technology. Do not use this skill to bypass design approval, project policies, or a more specific operational/security workflow.

## Prerequisites
- Confirm the user goal, scope, and applicable approval state.
- Read the relevant repository instructions and current project conventions.
- Resolve prerequisite skills only when their decision or artifact is needed; do not load the whole library by default.

## Inputs and expected context
- User request, affected feature/platform, target users, acceptance criteria, and known constraints.
- Existing code/design/doc artifacts and any version or approval record relevant to this domain.
- Available tools, integrations, environment, and explicitly permitted operations.
- Required outputs, evidence expectations, and unresolved decisions.

## Discovery checklist
1. Identify the current implementation, source of truth, and owner for the affected area.
2. Inspect the narrowest relevant manifests, routes/contracts, tests, assets, documentation, and history.
3. Record observed behavior separately from assumptions; identify dependencies, risks, and unknowns.
4. Reuse valid components, patterns, decisions, and artifacts; do not overwrite unrelated user work.
5. Confirm whether required external tools or credentials are actually available before relying on them.

## Detailed execution workflow
1. **Scope and readiness:** restate the in-scope outcome, affected platforms, constraints, and required approvals. Stop before gated work when approval is missing.
2. **Baseline:** follow this skill's domain workflow:
- Inventory route ownership, current deep links, authentication/authorization rules, and existing URL conventions.
- Define stable, descriptive paths and query parameters; keep secrets and personal data out of URLs.
- Specify unknown-route, refresh, back/forward, redirect-after-login, unauthorized, and deep-link behavior.
- Implement guards as user-experience controls while enforcing authorization on the backend; test direct navigation and reload.
3. **Plan:** map the intended change to requirements, dependencies, existing conventions, and rollback/recovery needs. Prefer an incremental approach with a clear boundary.
4. **Execute:** create or update only the listed deliverables; use established project tooling and do not fabricate integration or runtime results.
5. **Review:** inspect the resulting artifacts for correctness, security/privacy, compatibility, and consistency with linked contracts.
6. **Verify:** use the measurable gates below. Before any build, test, compile, run, install, package, benchmark, or artifact-generating check, obtain the approval required by the applicable project policy.
7. **Handoff:** pass verified decisions, changed paths, evidence, pending approvals, and unresolved issues to dependent skills/orchestrator.

## Decision tables and conditional behavior
| Condition | Required decision |
| --- | --- |
| Existing compatible convention or artifact | Reuse it; extend only when a documented gap remains. |
| Conflicting standard or unclear ownership | Record evidence and impact; request a decision before a material or irreversible change. |
| External integration/tool unavailable | Complete feasible offline work, state the limitation, and do not claim live integration. |
| User approval or execution approval absent | Pause the gated action; continue only with safe, permitted discovery or drafting. |
| Validation failure | Preserve output, diagnose the smallest root cause, and request any newly required approval before retrying. |

## Project-specific adaptation rules
- Honor existing framework, platform, localization, accessibility, security, naming, and testing conventions unless the request explicitly changes them.
- Adapt examples and deliverable paths to repository conventions; do not create empty directories solely to match a sample tree.
- For cross-platform work, document platform-specific behavior rather than assuming identical capabilities.
- Keep assumptions and exceptions visible, owned, and reviewable.

## Commands and configuration examples
- Prefer inspection and project-native commands; verify the command from manifests or documentation before proposing it.
- Commands that execute code, build, test, install, run, package, or create generated verification artifacts are subject to the project approval gate.
- Use placeholders for environment values; never include real credentials or tokens in docs, command history, fixtures, or examples.
- Record command, working directory, approval scope, outcome, and generated paths when execution is authorized.

## Required deliverables
- Route map and ownership
- URL and redirect contract
- Navigation and guard test cases
- Task-specific decision, assumption, or exception records when a decision affects later work.
- Verification evidence and an explicit list of unverified operations.

## Quality gates and acceptance criteria
- All in-scope routes are reachable through intended navigation or documented deep links.
- Refresh/back/forward and invalid routes have defined behavior.
- Protected data remains backend-authorized and sensitive values are absent from URLs.
- Deliverables are scoped, readable, linked to evidence, and consistent with project conventions.
- No undocumented destructive action, fabricated result, or success-shaped fallback is introduced.

## Security and privacy safeguards
- Apply least privilege and minimize collection, exposure, and retention of sensitive data.
- Never place credentials, OTPs, session tokens, encryption keys, or production secrets in source, generated examples, logs, screenshots, or public responses.
- Validate inputs at the authoritative backend boundary; use client-side controls only as usability support.
- Treat design files, telemetry, diagnostics, and archived artifacts as potentially sensitive; inspect access and contents before sharing.

## Failure handling and recovery
- If scope, permission, or a required design approval is unclear, pause the gated action and request a specific decision.
- If a tool or service is unavailable, provide the closest supported deliverable and explicitly mark the blocked step unverified.
- If implementation or validation fails, preserve user changes and diagnostic evidence; do not hide errors or silently switch approaches.
- For risky changes, define rollback/recovery before execution and stop if data safety cannot be established.

## Dependencies and handoffs
- Prerequisite/dependent skill identifiers: `05`, `11`, `39`
- Invoke dependencies only for concrete subtasks; pass their outputs and approval state rather than repeating discovery.
- Send downstream agents the affected paths, decisions, contract version, validation evidence, and unresolved risks.

## Reusable resources
- [Master orchestrator](../../../orchestration/MASTER_ORCHESTRATOR.md)
- [Skill routing](../../../orchestration/SKILL_ROUTING.md)
- [Design approval policy](../../../orchestration/DESIGN_APPROVAL_POLICY.md)
- [Shared standards and templates](../../../references/README.md)
- [Scenario coverage](../../../tests/scenario-matrix.md)

## Example workflow
Preserve a safe local return path after login while rejecting external redirect URLs.

## Verification evidence
Record the concrete artifact path, requirement/design identifier, review/test performed, outcome, and date/version. Distinguish automated execution from manual inspection and production evidence.

## Completion reporting
Report: scope completed; deliverables; decisions/assumptions; exact checks run and outcomes; checks not run and why; approvals still needed; residual risks; and next owner/action.

## Versioning and maintenance
Review this skill when its owning platform, framework, policy, or linked contract changes. Update version/changelog and scenario coverage with behavior-changing guidance; keep examples free of secrets and stale commands.
